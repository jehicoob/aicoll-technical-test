To view a code coverage report, you need to have xDebug installed and enabled. Once it's set up, run:

```bash
php artisan test --coverage
```

> ðŸ’¡ Note: Tests use an in-memory SQLite database for fast execution and test isolation. No additional database configuration is needed for testing.

> ðŸ’¡ If you don't have xDebug installed, you can follow the [official xDebug installation guide](https://xdebug.org/docs/install) for your environment.

This will execute all feature and unit tests to ensure the application is functioning correctly.
